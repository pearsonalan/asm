Experimentation with x86 assembly

The code in this project is my experimentation based on Ray Seafarth's excellent book "Introduction to 64 Bit 
Intel Assembly Language Programming for Linux" 
(http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Intel-Assembly-Language-Programming/dp/1478119209).

Some of this content may be example code from the book, and other content is my own code based on concepts from
Seafarth's text.
